## Open files in R using read.table and fread: X_test, X_train, Y_test, Y_train, subject_test, subject_train, features

Create X_testtrain by merging X_test and X_train on rows to X_testtrain
Add variable labels of the columns to X_testtrain, this is from the features file. 

Create subject_file from merge subject_test, subject_train

Create Activities from merge Y_test, Y_train.
Add labels of variable columnnames:
label in subject_file = "subject"
names(Activities) <- "activity"

Create total: by merge subject_file, Activities, X_testtrain on columns 

Use activity_labels text file to change of activity column: 
"1" =  "WALKING" 
"2" = "WALKING_UPSTAIRS" 
"3" = "WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS" 
"4"= "SITTING"
"5" = "STANDING"
"6" = "LAYING"

Subsetting part of total: the first two columns subject and activity and all the columns with a name that includes mean or std. 
I did this in three steps and merged them togehter to tidy_dataset_1

Controlled data.frame for missing values and shape. 

###########################

starting working with new name: tidy_dataset_1 = seconddataset 

removed the columns that included std in the title with select function. 
Prepared from features table loaded earlier a list containing the measurements that included mean, called 'vars'

Melt the dataset, so that the id variables are subject and activity and the measure variables were all the variables that 
about the mean, now included in 'vars'
This lead to narrowdataset of 4 columns

Last step is to dcast based on subject + activity and specified to give the mean. 
tidy_dataset_2 <- dcast(narrowdataset, subject + activity ~ variable, mean)

Checked the resulting tidy_dataset_2
head(tidy_dataset_2)
summary(tidy_dataset_2)

Created the file called tidydataset. 
write.table(tidy_dataset_2, file = "~/cursussen/R/getting and cleaning data/getdata-projectfiles-UCI HAR Dataset/UCI HAR Dataset/test/tidydataset.txt", row.name=FALSE)
