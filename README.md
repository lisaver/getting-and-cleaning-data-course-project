Thank you for looking at my course project. 


This project includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.md'
- 'CodeBook.md'
- run.analysis.txt
 
after running the script the first output is tidy_dataset_1 is consists of the data of 
- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.
- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.
 
with the variable labels in the columns of measurement containing information of the mean or standard deviation(std) based on 
- 'features.txt': List of all features.
 
with in the first two column respectively the subjects and the activities of 
- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels. 
- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.
- & 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.
